Q: suppose i have branches namely, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, main, master. 
if i checkout b5 and made changes, then without merging the branches
b5 into main, i run the command git push -u origin main from branch b5. 
what will happen ?


If you are on branch b5 and you run git push -u origin main without merging b5 into main, 
Git will try to push the local main branch to the remote repository (origin). 
However, since main does not contain the changes from b5, the push will be 
rejected by the remote repository.

Git will likely display an error message similar to:
error: failed to push some refs to 'remote_repository_url'

To successfully push your changes to main, you need to merge b4 into main first, resolve any conflicts, if any, and then push the changes.
