Q: suppose i have branches namely, b4, b3, b2, b1, main, master. 
if i checkout b4 and made changes, then without merging the branches 
b4 into main, i run the command git push origin main. what will happen ?


If you have checked out the b4 branch, made changes, and then without merging 
the b4 branch into main, you run the command git push origin main, Git will attempt to
push the main branch to the remote repository (origin) without including the changes 
from the b4 branch. This is because you haven't merged b4 into main, 
so the changes on b4 are not part of the main branch yet.

If the main branch on the remote repository has diverged 
(i.e., other changes have been pushed to main since you last pulled or synced), 
Git will reject the push because it would result in a non-fast-forward push, 
which could potentially overwrite or lose changes on the remote main branch.

To push the changes from b4 to main, you should first merge b4 into main locally 
and then push the main branch to the remote repository. Here's how you can do it:


1. Checkout the b4 branch:
git checkout b4

2. Make changes:
Edit, add, or delete files as needed.

3. Add and commit the changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. Merge b4 into main:
git checkout main
git merge b4

5. Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary:
If there are merge conflicts, resolve them as described earlier.

6. Commit the merge:
git commit

7. Push the main branch to the remote repository:
git push origin main


This way, the changes from the b4 branch will be included in the main branch, 
and you can push the updated main branch to the remote repository.
