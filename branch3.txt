Q: changes in b3 and merging the changes to b2 (b3 with b2)
suppose i have branches namely, b3, b2, b1, main, master. 
if i checkout b3 and made changes then merge the branches b3 and b2.
how can we do that ?


To merge branches b3 and b2, after checking out the b3 branch and
making changes, you can follow these steps:

1. Checkout the b3 branch:
git checkout b3

2. Make changes:
Edit, add, or delete files as needed.

3. Add and commit the changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. Checkout the b2 branch:
git checkout b2

5. Merge the b3 branch into b2:
git merge b3

6. Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary:
If there are merge conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. 
You can use git status to see which files have conflicts, edit 
the conflicting files to resolve the conflicts, and then 
add the resolved files with git add before committing the merge.

7. Commit the merge:
If there were no conflicts or once you have resolved them, commit the merge:
git commit

8. Push the changes:
Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository:
git push origin b2

This will merge the changes from the b3 branch into the b2 branch.
