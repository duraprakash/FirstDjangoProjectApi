Hello, I'm from branch 1
git push -u origin b1

If you have three branches named b1, main, and master, 
and you've checked out the b1 branch and made some changes 
that you want to push to the b1 branch, you can do so 
with the following steps:

1. Make sure you are on the b1 branch by using the command:
git checkout b1

2. Add the changes you want to commit:
git add .

3. Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. Push the changes to the b1 branch:
git push origin b1


This will push your changes from the local b1 branch to the remote b1 branch.
